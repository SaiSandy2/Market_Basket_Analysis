## Introduction

In this repository, we explore various techniques and algorithms for Market Basket Analysis, with a focus on understanding customer behavior and optimizing product placement strategies. The code provided here can be used to mine association rules and extract valuable insights from transactional data.

## Data

We provide a sample dataset in the `data` directory, which includes transactional data of customer purchases. The data is in a standard CSV format, with each row representing a transaction and each column representing a specific product. You can also use your own dataset by following the same format.

## Methodology

Our analysis involves the implementation of popular algorithms such as Apriori to extract frequent itemsets and association rules from the transactional data.

## Results

The results of the analysis are presented in the form of discovered association rules and their corresponding support, confidence, and lift values. Additionally, we provide insights and interpretations derived from the analysis, which can be used to make informed business decisions.
